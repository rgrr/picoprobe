# Yet Another Picoprobe

## Overview

YAPicoprobe allows a Pico / RP2040 to be used as USB -> SWD and UART bridge. This means
it can be used as a debugger and serial console for another Pico or any other SWD compatible controller.

YAPicoprobe is a fork of the original https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe[Picoprobe]
and was created due to my lazyness to follow the PR discussions and delays with unknown outcome.

Another reason for this fork is that I wanted to play around with SWD, RTT, PIO etc pp, so
the established development process was a little bit hindering.

Finally there is **Y**et **A**nother **Picoprobe** around, the YAPicoprobe.



## Features

* **FAST**, at least faster than most other picoprobes, see link:doc/benchmarks.adoc[benchmarks]
* standard debug tool connectivity
** CMSIS-DAPv2 WinUSB (driver-less vendor-specific bulk) - CMSIS compliant debug channel
** CMSIS-DAPv1 HID - CMSIS compliant debug channel as a fallback
* MSC - drag-n-drop support of UF2 firmware image Ã  la https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink[DAPLink]
  for RP2040 Pico / PicoW and nRF52832/833/840 targets
* CDC - virtual com port for bidirectional communication with target
** UART connection between target and probe is redirected
** RTT terminal channel is automatically redirected into this CDC (if there is no
   CMSIS-DAPv2/MSC connection)
* https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/systemview/[SystemView] support over TCP/IP (NCM/ECM/RNDIS)
* CDC - virtual com port for (debug) logging of the probe
* optional CDC sigrok probe - data collection on eight digital and three analog channels
  (logic analyzer and oscilloscope) with auto-trigger capability.
  See link:doc/sigrok.adoc[here] for more information
* LED for state indication
* Other Benefits
** on Windows no more Zadig fiddling because the underlying protocols of CMSIS-DAPv1 and v2 are driver-less
** easy drag-n-drop (or copy) upload of a firmware image to the target via the probe
** no more reset push button (or disconnect/connect cycle)  to put the target into BOOTSEL mode
** auto detection of RP2040/nRF52/Generic targets



## Details
### Known Devices
* RP2040 (and its flash "win w25q16jv"), size of the targets flash is automatically detected
* nRF52832/833/840
* other SWD compatible (Arm) devices with limitations in MSC access

### Supported Probe Hardware
* https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html[Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico W] +
  If you have to choose between a Pico and a Pico W, I'ld recommend the simple Pico, because Pico W does not
  add any features
* https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html[Pico Debug Probe] +
  
  

Other RP2040 hardware will work as well, e.g. https://mcuoneclipse.com/2023/04/08/open-source-picolink-raspberry-pi-rp2040-cmsis-dap-debug-probe/[picoLink]
is happy with the firmware image for the Pico.

Firmware images can be downloaded from https://github.com/rgrr/yapicoprobe/releases[github].


### Probe / Target Wiring
Wires between Pico probe and target board are shown below.  At least three wires (plus supply) are required:
SWCLK, SWDIO and Gnd.  The Reset line is optional.  If target UART RX/TX are used, additional two wires are needed.
Sigrok inputs go extra.

|===

NOTE: For best RP2040 support, OpenOCD bundled with PlatformIO is recommended. 
      See <<platformio>>


#### Parameter Optimization

YaPicoprobe tries to identify the connecting tool and sets some internal parameters for best performance.
Those settings are:

.Parameter Optimization
[%autowidth]
[%header]
|===
|Tool | Parameter

|pyOCD / CMSIS-DAPv2
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=1 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=1024

|OpenOCD / CMSIS-DAPv2
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=2 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=1024

|unknown / CMSIS-DAPv2
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=1 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=64

|CMSIS-DAPv1 HID
|DAP_PACKET_COUNT=1 +
DAP_PACKET_SIZE=64
|===


#### SWD Adapter Speed
The tools above allow specification of the adapter speed.  This is the clock frequency between probe and target device.
Unfortunately DAP converts internally the frequency into delays which are always even multiples of clock cycles.
That means that actual clock speeds are `125MHz / (2*n)`, `n>=3` -> 20833kHz, 12500kHz, 10417kHz, ...

Normally the requested frequency is rounded down according to the possible values from above.  But if the specified frequency 
is completely out of range, the allowed maximum target SWD frequency is used, e.g. for the RP2040 24MHz.

Actually usable frequency depends on cabling and the DAP speed.  If the DAP cannot access memory with speed determined by the host, it responds
with WAIT and the host needs to retry.

Effects of cabling should be clear: the longer the cables plus some more effects, the worse the signals.  Which effectively means
slowing down clock frequency is required to get the data transported.

[TIP]
====
SWCLK speed for MSC and RTT (below) is set according to the latest used tool setup.
E.g. `pyocd reset -f 5000000 -t rp2040` sets SWCLK to 5MHz.
====

[NOTE]
====
SWD clock frequency is also limited by the target controller.  For nRF52 targets default clock is set to 6MHz,
for unknown SWD targets 2MHz are used.
====


### MSC - Mass Storage Device Class
Via MSC the so called "drag-n-drop" supported is implemented.  Actually this also helps in copying a UF2 image directly into the target via command line.

MSC write access, i.e. flashing of the target, is device dependent and thus works only for a few selected
devices which are in my range of interest.  Those devices are the RP2040 (and its flash "win w25q16jv") and the
Nordic nRF52 family (namely nRF52832/833/840). +
For the RP2040 some special flash routines has been implemented.  For nRF52 flashing
regular DAPLink modules have been taken.  Which also implies, that extending the probes capabilities shouln't be
too hard.

[NOTE]
====
* RP2040: flash erase takes place on a 64KByte base:  on the first write to a 64 KByte page, 
  the corresponding page is erased.  That means, that multiple UF2 images can be flashed into the 
  target as long as there is no overlapping within 64 KByte boundaries
* nRF52: whole chip is erased on first write operation of an UF2 image which means that
  only one UF2 image can be flashed
====

Because CMSIS-DAP access should be generic, flashing of other SWD compatible devices is tool dependant
(OpenOCD/pyOCD).


### RTT - Real Time Transfer
https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/[RTT]
allows transfer from the target to the host in "realtime" via the SWD interface.

The RTT control block on the target is automatically detected.  Currently channels 0 and 1 are supported.

To get the RTT channels running, code on the target has to be either instrumented or adopted.

[NOTE]
====
* only the devices RAM is scanned for an RTT control block, for unknown devices
  RAM the range 0x20000000-0x2003ffff is assumed
* don't be too overwhelmed about Seggers numbers in
  the above mentioned document.  The data must still be
  transferred which is not taken into account in the diagram
  (of course the target processor has finished
  after writing the data)
* only one of CMSIS-DAP / MSC / RTT can access the
  target at the same time.  RTT is disconnected in 
  case CMSIS-DAP or MSC are claiming access
====


#### Terminal I/O

RTT channel 0 is used for bidirectional console communication.  This channel is directed into the UART CDC
of the target device.

Communication is birectional, but don't expect high transfer rates from host to target.


#### SystemView

RTT channel 1 is used for communication with Seggers https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/systemview/[SystemView].
YAPicoprobe provides the data over TCP at port 19111 which is the default for SystemView communication.
Default IP address of the probe (if not built otherwise) is 192.168.14.1.

[NOTE]
====
SystemView communication via TCP/IP had been chosen to spare you from another CDC port and also
because SystemView over COM port works on my Linux device just until v3.30 (Segger promises
a fix for > 3.50a, nevertheless TCP/IP is used...)

### LED Indications

.LED Indications
[%autowidth]
[%header]
|===
| State | Indication

| no target found
| 5Hz blinking

| DAPv1 connected
| LED on, off for 100ms once per second

| DAPv2 connected
| LED on, off for 100ms twice per second

| MSC active
| LED on, off for 100ms thrice per second

| UART data from target
| slow flashing: 300ms on, 700ms off

| target found
| LED off, flashes once per second for 20ms

| RTT control block found
| LED off, flashes twice per second for 20ms

| RTT data received
| LED off, flashes thrice per second for 20ms

| sigrok running
| 10Hz flashing

| sigrok waiting for auto trigger
| 10Hz negative flashing (flicker)
|===

[NOTE]
====
pyOCD does not disconnect correctly at an end of a gdb debug session so the LED still shows a connection.
To get out of this situation issue `pyocd reset -t rp2040` or similar.
====

#### Pico Debug Probe

The Pico Debug Probe has four additional LEDs.  Assignment is as follows:

.Pico Debug Probe Additional LEDs
[%autowidth]
[%header]
|===
| LED | Color | Indication

| UART_TX
| yellow
| 5ms flash, if target sends data

| UART_RX
| green
| 20ms flash, if target gets data

| DAP_TARGET_RUNNING
| yellow
| set by host tool

| DAP_CONNECTED
| green
| set by host tool

|===

[NOTE]
====
* currently OpenOCD sets both DAP_* LEDs on CMSIS-DAP connection
* pyOCD currently does not set the DAP_* LEDs at all
====

----

### Network Configuration

SystemView connectivity over TCP/IP is on most systems not configuration free.  

#### Debian

On Debian the configuration is as follows:

* after connecting the probe with the host, `ip a` shows its network interface, e.g. `enxfe<your-probe>`.
  If the network interface already shows an IP address everything is fine and you are ready
* if not, then you can get the IP address with `sudo dhclient enxfe<your-probe>`
* to make the permanent add the following lines to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

[source]
----
allow-hotplug enxfe<your-probe>
iface enxfe<your-probe> inet dhcp
----

On my system this unfortunately leads to error messages (which are harmless) if the probe is not connected.

The default address of the probe is 192.168.14.1.  If there is a collision with the current setup of the
host, the probe firmware has to be rebuilt with `-DOPT_NET_192_168=<subnet>`.

#### Win10

A certain version of Win10 is required for USB-NCM connectivity.  Exact version is unknown.

The driver needs to be installed manually.  Procedure is roughly as follows:

* in "Device Manager" search for `YaPicoprobe NCM` with an exclamation mark
* "Update Driver"
* "Browse my computer for drivers"
* "Let me pick..."
* "Network adapters"
* "Microsoft"
* "UsbNcm Host Device" - if this is not available, then the version of Win10 is not ready for USB-NCM
* confirm any dialog boxes
* if `ipconfig` on a command line shows `192.168.14.2` for an Ethernet adapter, the procedure has most likely
  succeeded and SystemView is ready for operation

#### Win11

It is said, that USB-NCM is working out of the box.  This is not tested.


### PlatformIO [[platformio]]
https://platformio.org/[PlatformIO] configuration in `platformio.ini` is pretty straight forward:

.PlatformIO configuration
[source,yaml]
----
[env:pico]
framework = arduino
platform = https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi
board = rpipicow
board_build.core = earlephilhower
upload_protocol = cmsis-dap
debug_tool = cmsis-dap
monitor_speed = 115200
monitor_port  = /dev/ttyPicoTarget
----

The firmware image can alternativly copied directly (and faster) via MSC with custom upload:

.PlatformIO copy configuration
[source,yaml]
----
[env:pico_cp]
...
upload_protocol = custom
upload_command = cp .pio/build/pico_cp/firmware.uf2 /media/picoprobe
...
----

I'm sure there are smarter ways to specify the image path.

Optional: there is also a special PlatformIO handling in the probe: it ignores the defensive 1MHz clock setting which is used by
the above contained OpenOCD.  Standard clock is thus 15MHz.  If this is too fast, set the frequency with
`pyocd reset -f 1100000 -t rp2040` or similar.  If this is too slow, use `pyocd reset -f 50000000 -t rp2040`.


#### RTT
To use RTT for debug/console output the following has to be done:

* in `platformio.ini`:
----
[env:pico]
...
lib_deps =
    ...
    koendv/RTT Stream
----

* in main.cpp:
[source,C]
----
...
#include <RTTStream.h>
...
RTTStream rtt;
...
rtt.println("main module");
----

* in other modules:
[source,C]
----
...
#include <RTTStream.h>
...
extern RTTStream rtt;
...
rtt.println("sub module");
----



## Internals

### Building from Source [[how-to-build]]

Building from source is done with the help of a stub Makefile which eases integration into Eclipse (but can be
used from command line as well).  The Makefile creates via cmake a `build.ninja` which is responsible for
the actual build process.

To build the project, there must be somewhere a recent https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk[Pico SDK] and
the environment variable `PICO_SDK_PATH` must point to it.

If you want to adopt YAPicoprobe options to your needs, check CMakeLists.txt and invoke cmake accordingly.

Requirements:

* arm-none-eabi-gcc
* make, cmake, ninja
* Pico SDK

.Clone yapicoprobe including submodules
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/rgrr/yapicoprobe.git
cd yapicoprobe
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

.General build sequence
[source,bash]
----
# create _build/ninja.build for a debug target
make cmake-create-debug

# build yapicoprobe, output in _build/picoprobe.uf2
make all

# clean build files
make clean
----

.Build sequence for a specific board [pico|pico_w|pico_debug_probe]
[source,bash]
----
make clean-build
make cmake-create-debug PICO_BOARD=pico_debug_probe
make all
----

.Build firmware images for supported boards, images can be found in images/yapicoprobe*.uf2
[source,bash]
----
make create-images
----

.Bare call of cmake
[source,bash]
----
mkdir _build; cd _build
cmake .. -D<option>=<value> -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w
cmake --build .
# output in picoprobe.elf/uf2/hex/bin
----

If you want to know the several options use the one liner in the build directory:
`cmake -LH . | sed -n -e '/OPT_/{x;1!p;g;$!N;p;D;}' -e h`. +
Or use simply `make show-options` in the projects root.
